# scroller

Hello Everyone and hello Gophers - GoWithAndy ;)
I'd like to introduce you to termbox. 
Termbox is a simple and minimalistic library in the Go programming language
that provides a way to create cross-platform text-based user interfaces (TUIs).
It allows developers to build terminal-based applications 
with interactive UI elements such as buttons, text boxes, input fields, and more.

Termbox abstracts the low-level details of interacting with the terminal, 
making it easier for developers to create text-based UIs without worrying 
about platform-specific intricacies. It supports a limited set of colors, 
keyboard input, and mouse events, making it suitable for creating basic 
terminal applications.

I wrote a simple scroller to demonstrate the magic behind the termbox. 
I hope you'll like it. I was inspired by early '80 assembly demos on Atari 800XL, 
ZX Spectrum and Commodore64. 
Unfortunately termbox lacking of wait for vertical retrace and hardware scrolling 
like this lovely one on Atari and Commodore.

Good luck and remember : Go With Andy!
Cheers!
